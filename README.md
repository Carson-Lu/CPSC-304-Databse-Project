# CPSC Database Project
The domain of the application is a database for various online services (both those that require and donâ€™t require subscriptions) and the focus is going to be on the data about the online services as well as the users of these online services. The front end GUI will be developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS, while the backend database schema and data manipulation will be handled with Oracle JDBC.


The project can be accessed here: https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~clu56/Project/index.php

However, the SQL file must be loaded directly into the Oracle database for this to work.
